#How does Maxwell use it?

* Reusable Complex Forms
 * We knew things were going to be tough
 * Could build ui elements that had their own logic without rearchitecting our application every day
* Mobile app
 * Great performance in a light library
 * Same deal as above - "tons of cards that all need their own logic"
